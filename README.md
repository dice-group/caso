# The Road Traffic Accident Severity Ontology (RTASO)

The **Road Traffic Accident Severity Ontology (RTASO)** is a formalized knowledge representation framework designed to model factors influencing the severity of car accidents.

The **Road Accident Severity Ontology (RTASO)** addresses the challenge of data inconsistency by providing a comprehensive and reusable semantic model for representing car accident severity and its associated factors. 

RTASO leverages established ontologies and vocabularies to ensure interoperability with existing datasets and tools while introducing domain-specific concepts tailored to accident analysis. 

By formalizing the relationships between accident entities, RTASO enables advanced querying, reasoning, and knowledge extraction, supporting applications in accident investigation, risk assessment, and policy development.
